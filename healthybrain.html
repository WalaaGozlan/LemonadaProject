	<h4>Get mental stimulation and improve your logic thinking</h4>
	<p>Through research with mice and humans, scientists have found that brainy activities stimulate new connections between nerve cells and may even help the brain generate new cells, developing neurological "plasticity" and building up a functional reserve that provides a hedge against future cell loss.</p>

	<p>Any mentally stimulating activity should help to build up your brain. Read, take courses, try "mental gymnastics," such as word puzzles or math problems Experiment with things that require manual dexterity as well as mental effort, such as drawing, painting, and other crafts.</p>

	<h4>Build social networks</h4>
	<p>Strong social ties have been associated with a lower risk of dementia, as well as lower blood pressure and longer life expectancy.</p>


	<h4>Care for your emotions</h4>
	<p>People who are anxious, depressed, sleep-deprived, or exhausted tend to score poorly on cognitive function tests. Poor scores don't necessarily predict an increased risk of cognitive decline in old age, but good mental health and restful sleep are certainly important goals.</p>
