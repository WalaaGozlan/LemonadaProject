	<h4>Practicing Healthy Eating Habits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
	<p> Keep a food diary for a few days. Write down everything you eat and the time of day you eat it. This will help you uncover your habits. For example, you might discover that you always seek a sweet snack to get you through the mid-afternoon energy slump.</p>
</div>
	<h4>Get active and manage your weight</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
	<p>Getting and staying active can reduce your risk of developing heart disease. It can also be a great mood booster and stress buster.</p>
	<p>Do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. One way to achieve this target is by doing 30 minutes of activity on 5 days a week. Fit it in where you can, such as by cycling to work.</p>
	<p>Being overweight can increase your risk of heart disease. Stick to a healthy, balanced diet low in fat and sugar, with plenty of fruit and vegetables, combined with regular physical activity.</p>
