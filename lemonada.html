	<p>The notion that our mind, emotions, and body play a significant role in our health is far from new. Modern day science continues to prove this theory and has demonstrated that our thoughts and emotions play a critical role in all aspects of our health. This means that by taking care of our psychological well-being, we may be able to prevent medical illness or speed our recovery when we are sick. This balance is as important for adults than for children.</p><br>

<p>Our different emotional states ranging from love and happiness to anger and anxiety can cause chain reactions that affect our blood chemistry, heart rate and the activity of every cell and organ in the body which can influence structures such as our gastrointestinal tract and immune system. Our thoughts and emotions can also affect our body's response to stressors, which can cause physical problems such as aches and pains, disturbed sleep, low energy, headaches, heart palpitations, upset stomach or weight gain or loss. These physical symptoms are signs that our emotional health is out of balance. By paying attention to our emotional and mental states, we can help ourselves stay healthy. By teaching our kids how to maintain this healthy balance you can help them avoid many physical symptoms in the future.</p><br><br>
